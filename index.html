    <h3>Written Questions</h3>
    <ol>
        1. The first visualization shows my boss the top 10 video games of all time by displaying a bar chart of 
        the top 10 games by global sales. For the second question, the boss can see which genres have the largest 
        share of the pie. Moreover, if they want to see the genre popularities in a different region they can 
        toggle the buttons to display each region's data. Although pie charts should be used for "parts of a whole"
        data, this pie chart is helpful because the boss can instantly see which genre has the largest 'slice' of the pie.
        The last chart is very straightforward and on the y-axis directly shows the top publisher for each genre
        on the y-axis labels and also shows the corresponding sales for that publisher within each genre. 
    </ol>

        2. One way d3 was helpful was by allowing me to update my own data with a javascript function. In other words,
        I could toggle between the regional data by defining a JS function that would feed in a new column of data. Another
        way d3 was helpful was the tooltip feature which allowed me to easily display some of my data in a separate 
        box for ease of readability. A third way d3 was helpful was by allowing me to have a color preset for the pie chart.
        Instead of having to define my own range based on the data they provided presets that allowed for a unique scale of colors. 
    </ol>
    <ol>
        3. One reason d3 may not be the best is if you want to perform statistical analysis and then easily include it in the 
        visualizations. Maybe I'm wrong because I don't know JS, but it seems that python has more functionalities to perform statistical
        tests. So within a python framework like matplotlib you could easily add in the data from any statistial modules you use. D3 
        is reliant on JS which to my understanding provides less frameworks for mathematical analysis. 
        Another reason d3 may not be the best is that the desired visualization may be generated in a simpler way. 
        In doing some research on d3, I found that SVG's don't natively support text-wrapping like CSS.
        A third reason d3 may not be the best is if we want to quickly throw together a simple visualization. While
        d3 isn't terribly complicated, you have to build each part of the visualization up from scratch (e.g. Adding bars
        to the chart separately). It may be easier to use a framework that auto-generates lines, bars or 'pieces of a pie'
        when making a data visualization.

        4. I would overall characterize my dashboard as fairly accessible. Some obvious pitfalls occur for people
        who may have certain visual impairements. As the Medium articles notes, colorblind people
        sometimes have a harder time making distinctions on certain visualizations. My pie-chart is not the most colorblind
        friendly as many similar colors are clustered close together and there's not much sharp contrast between the colors. Moreover,
        a blind person could not get any value from my dashboard as I do not include any audio component to convey
        my data. To fix these issues, I could rely on more sharp contrasted colors in the pie-chart and included alt-text
        that could be read by audio-assisting software that some
        blind people use. 
        Some strengths of my dashboard is that each chart has clear titles and labels without overally distracting
        text or colors. 
        
    </ol>

        5. One big way I could have implemented my design to be more accessible to the visually impaired in particular 
        would have been to make a fully different chart for the thrid question. My third chart showcases the top publisher
        (the main info my boss needs) for each genre within the text of a paranthesis. Some form of heatmap may have been more
        visually clear especially for somebody who can't see text too well or may have some form of dyslexia. I was mainly
        held back from this implementation by time constraints. The heatmap framework was something I was unfamiliar with 
        so I stuck to the bar chart and displayed the main info with text.
